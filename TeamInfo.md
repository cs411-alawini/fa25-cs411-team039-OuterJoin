## Project Summary

Car Tinder is an interactive mobile/web application designed to simplify the used car buying experience. Buying a car can be overwhelming due to fluctuating prices, inconsistent vehicle histories, varying fuel economy, and reliability concerns. Our app transforms the process into a fun and engaging experience by allowing users to swipe through personalized car recommendations based on their preference. Itâ€™s the same high stakes and high financial implications as Tinder, but for cars!!
